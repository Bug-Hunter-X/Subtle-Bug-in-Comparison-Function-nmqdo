This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to return the larger of two numbers. The function works correctly for most positive numbers but has a flaw when dealing with negative numbers.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing, particularly around edge cases.
